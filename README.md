That was a project i made in university. It didnt went well because of the restrictions. The goal was to move the pawn to its correct move and eat the white pawns.But some of the if states didnt go as expect it .There were two possible game modes. 1) Player vs AI 2)AI vs AI.The AI moving by random values.
